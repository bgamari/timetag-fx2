FPGA Timetagger FX2 firmware
Author: Ben Gamari <bgamari@physics.umass.edu>


This firmware was written for the FPGA time-tagger. It configures three endpoints:

  EP2 (OUT): Commands from host to FPGA
  EP6 (IN):  Data from FPGA to host
  EP8 (IN):  Command replies from FPGA to host

See bulkloop.c for more details on the exact endpoint configuration.

The firmware accepts a few commands from the host in the form of
vendor-specific USB commands,

  0x01: Update EP6 AUTOINLEN.
        Data contains the new value of AUTOINLEN in bytes.
        DATA[0]: Lower byte
        DATA[1]: Upper byte

  0x02: Flush EP6 pending packets.
        No data.
